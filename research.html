			<p style="font-size:15px; margin-top: 10px"> This website was very helpful as it gave me concept of what I want my website to look like. I took inspiration from this website to make navigation bar and add ad banner in my website and also an offer for discount as seen in the top. I made siliar layout but also added highlighting feature i.e. highlighting the tab on hovering it over. This is absent in the other website.</p>

This may not look same but I took inspiration from this and places the products in card style in my webiste. I created different classes as row and column and card and style them accordingly. Lecture slides were studies for the creation and also some tutorials to make the products card.</p>
